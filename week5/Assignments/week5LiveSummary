    -You showed how to build them.
    -You explained the different parts of them.
    -You explained how to find said parts in the URL.
    -You showed the expected output for the example, and how we knew we did it right.

-Next you went over POST requests   
    -You explained that it is the most secure of the methods, but is used less often.
    -You showed us an example, explained what is happening and why.
    -POST is in JSON format.
